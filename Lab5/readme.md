## Make a cardboard servo motor mount

* It still has the old components from lab4 because I wasn't sure how much of it wanted to keep in the final design. Ended up taking off the unnecessary parts (OLED screen, potentiometer, and light sensor)

## Make the service panel for your box.

* I kind of messed up cutting the top flap, so I split it into 2 parts and taped one of the parts as the 4th wall.

## Make your box open using the servo motor

* I had to turn the servo 90 degrees so it would swing open the box via an attached wire

* Just a simple arm that attaches to the servo via a wire taped to the lid of the box
