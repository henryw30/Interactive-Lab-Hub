# Part A: Solder OLED

# Part B: Make a Lowly Multimeter

* see MyWork/lowly_multimeter

# Part C: Using a Time-based Digital Sensor

* ran serial monitor code in MyWork/sample_rotary. It worked!

# Part D: Make Your Arduino Sing!

* code in MyWork/toneMelody


1. How would you change the code to make the song play twice as fast?

    * lower the pauseBetweenNotes variable by lowering the multiplier on noteDuration

2. What is the song playing?

    * Star Wars theme!

# Part E: Make Your Own Timer

1. Note that for some of you, the time may seem to be decremented by 10 each second (that is, from 670=>660). Why is this? Do you think it's a hardware or software issue?

    * I never ran into this issue, but I think this is a hardware issue because the screen needs to print 3 digits

2. Make a short video showing how your timer works, and what happens when time is up!

    * [Jeopardy Timer!](https://photos.app.goo.gl/cf4rHeXn4mzPa2Hy7)

    * This sets a timer according to the value read from the potentiometer and displays the time remaining with the Jeopardy theme playing

3. Post a link to the completed lab report your GitHub repo
